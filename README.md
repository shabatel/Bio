In this project we will work with 9 complete genomes of viruses that belong to the coronavirus group of viruses.
    We will compute the distances between each pair of genomes using a combination of FASTA and BLAST algorithms for
    fast global alignment
    We will use these distances to construct the neighbor-joining tree
    This tree will help us learn about their evolution
    
Sequence pairwise alignment: All the sequence files need to be of fasta format.

to run: 


$ python pairwise scoring_matrix.txt seq1.fasta seq2.fasta ... seqN.fasta
